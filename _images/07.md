title: Tutor
caption: I have been working as a paid tutor since my high school years, primarily teaching subjects like chemistry and math. I have a genuine passion for explaining complex concepts to others because it deepens my own understanding of the subject matter. Assisting fellow students who are facing difficulties is something I find gratifying. I genuinely enjoy helping people and find great satisfaction in receiving their appreciation. <br><br> During my college years, I sought the opportunity to join the Academic Resource Center to continue my tutoring efforts, similar to what I had done during high school.
